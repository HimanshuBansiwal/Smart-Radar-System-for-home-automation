# Smart-Radar-System-for-home-automation
A smart radar system is designed for home automation purpose. it will detect an object up to 4mtr. And give the distance and angle of an object from the device. Arduino uno used as a development board with ultrasonic sensor which is sending and receiving ultrasonic wave, which gives the information about object. for surveillance a servo motor is used on which Ultrasonic sensor is mounted and responsible for rotating the sensor from 0 to 180 degree. So it can be use as home security device. On detecting the unknown object it will generate  signal.
